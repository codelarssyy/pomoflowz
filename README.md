# [Pomoflow](https://pomoflowtime.netlify.app/)

A productivity timer that includes Flowtime and Pomodoro.

The **Flowtime** technique is a time management technique that involves working on a task until your focus has dropped and taking a break based off of that time. It is useful for tasks that require deeper thought and concentration. The **Pomodoro** technique involves working for a set amount of time, typically around 25 minutes, and then taking a short break for about 5 minutes. This repeats until the 4th pomodoro, where a longer break is taken.

Both techniques are quite useful and can be applied in different scenarios. This app is meant to contain stopwatches/timers that can achieve the goals of Flowtime and Pomodoro.
